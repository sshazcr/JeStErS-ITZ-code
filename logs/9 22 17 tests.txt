tests done today:
linear gear maintenance-
just double checking it works
test 1: left linear gears are probably running opposite direction. reversing values so that
itll go same direction. also going to half speed the gears some more from 60 to 70ish

changes to code:
-fixed linear gear
-started to clean up drivetrain
-finished cleaning up drivetrain, should probably double check and test it
cleaned up linear gear code
